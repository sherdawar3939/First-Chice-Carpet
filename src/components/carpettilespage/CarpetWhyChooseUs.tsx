        Benefits of Carpet Tiles in Commercial and Residential Spaces
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-black/90 text-md mt-4 font-bold">
        1. Commercial Spaces:
      </h3>
      <p className="text-black/70 text-sm mb-4 text-justify">
        Carpet tiles are an excellent choice for office spaces, showrooms,
        retail stores, and other commercial areas. Their sound-absorbing
        properties reduce noise, creating a quieter and more productive
        environment. They offer flexibility in design, enabling businesses to
        create a brand-specific look by mixing and matching colors or creating
        custom layouts.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-black/90 text-md font-bold">
        2. Residential Spaces:
      </h3>
      <p className="text-black/70 text-sm text-justify">
        In homes, carpet tiles offer a soft and warm underfoot feel, ideal for
        living rooms, bedrooms, and play areas. Their modular design ensures
        easy replacement of individual tiles, making them family-friendly,
        especially in homes with kids or pets. Homeowners in Dubai can opt for
        moisture-resistant carpet tiles, perfect for areas with higher humidity
        levels, like basements or entranceways.
